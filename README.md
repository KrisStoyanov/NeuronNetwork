# NeuronNetwork
## Intro
This course project is an university assignment for the "Intelligent Systems & Data Mining" course at [Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/). The project is created on the Unity3D game engine, version 2019.4.8f1.

## Assignment
This project aims to compare two different types of neural networks, which are trained and tested on an "endless-runner" game. The final goal is to extract statistical data on their behavior; i.e. the generation with the number of survived individuals that have reached a score of 2000.

## Contents
This project is divided into three crucial components:
- Two dynamically adjustable neural networks - one that learns through back-propagation, and a second one that uses single-point crossover and genetic algorithms;
- Logic for generating generations of individuals, each individual with its own neural network;
- A convenient user interface which allows for the adjustment of the required neural network parameters before the game is launched.
